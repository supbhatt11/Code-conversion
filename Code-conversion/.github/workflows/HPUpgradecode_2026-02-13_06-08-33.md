## General Constraints and Industry Standards

- Always verify model-specific service manual for RAM/CPU slot, socket type, and maximum supported hardware.
- BIOS/UEFI updates are often required for new hardware compatibility.
- RAM upgrades limited by physical slots and soldered configurations.
- Most ultrathin models (Spectre, some Envy/EliteBook) have soldered RAM/CPU.
- GPU upgrades are rarely supported except in some workstation-class models.

## Step-by-step Validation Report

1. **Test coverage**: Each script is covered with unit, regression, system, functional, positive, and negative tests.
2. **Test framework**: PyTest is used for all scripts, as required for Python code.
3. **Test scenarios**:
   - Positive: Valid upgrade scenario with no issues.
   - Negative: All possible upgrade constraints (soldered RAM/CPU, missing BIOS support, single RAM slot, unsupported socket, etc.).
   - Regression: Multiple issues in one scenario.
   - Functional/System: Parametrized tests for batch validation.

## Troubleshooting Recommendations

- If a test fails, check for:
  - Incorrect system_info dictionary keys or values.
  - Mismatched socket or BIOS support status.
  - Soldered RAM/CPU not flagged correctly.
  - Missing or incorrect hardware detection logic.
- Update BIOS and verify hardware compatibility as per test failure messages.
- For soldered RAM/CPU, upgrading is not possible; recommend model replacement.
- For BIOS-related failures, update BIOS to latest version from HP support.
- Always cross-check model-specific hardware/service manual.
