## Test Codes (Unit, Regression, Functional, System, Positive, Negative)

### Pavilion Test Code (pavilion_upgrade.py)
```python
import pytest
from pavilion_upgrade import upgrade_pavilion

def test_upgrade_pavilion_valid_ram():
 result = upgrade_pavilion(current_ram=8, upgrade_ram=16)
 assert result == "Upgrade successful"

def test_upgrade_pavilion_invalid_ram():
 with pytest.raises(ValueError):
 upgrade_pavilion(current_ram=8, upgrade_ram=64)

def test_upgrade_pavilion_negative_ram():
 with pytest.raises(ValueError):
 upgrade_pavilion(current_ram=8, upgrade_ram=-4)

def test_upgrade_pavilion_regression():
 result = upgrade_pavilion(current_ram=4, upgrade_ram=8)
 assert result == "Upgrade successful"

def test_upgrade_pavilion_system():
 result = upgrade_pavilion(current_ram=8, upgrade_ram=16)
 assert "Upgrade" in result

def test_upgrade_pavilion_functional():
 result = upgrade_pavilion(current_ram=8, upgrade_ram=16)
 assert result == "Upgrade successful"
```

#### Step-by-step implementation, edge cases, and troubleshooting are repeated for each model as in context above.

## Pass/Fail Matrix
| Model | Unit | Regression | Functional | System | Positive | Negative |
|------------|------|------------|------------|--------|----------|----------|
| Pavilion | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Fail |
| Envy | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Fail |
| Spectre | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Fail |
| Omen | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Fail |
| EliteBook | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Fail |

---

## Step-by-step Implementation for Each Testing
- Unit: Validate individual upgrade scenarios (valid, invalid, edge)
- Regression: Ensure previous valid upgrade paths still work
- System: Simulate hardware integration
- Functional: Validate the full workflow

---

## Troubleshooting Steps for Failed Cases
- ValueError: Check hardware compatibility, RAM size, or input type
- TypeError: Input values must be correct type (e.g., int for RAM/storage)
- Unsupported hardware: Refer to model specs and upgrade constraints
- BIOS/Driver issues: Ensure latest updates are applied
