# Summary Table: Dependencies and Upgrade Constraints

| Model      | OS Upgrade | RAM Upgrade                    | Processor Upgrade        | Key Dependencies & Constraints                       |
|------------|------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Pavilion   | Win 10/11, Chrome OS | Up to 16GB (check slots, BIOS)    | Not supported (soldered) | BIOS version, RAM slot availability, chipset         |
| Envy       | Win 10/11, Chrome OS | Up to 16/32GB (varies by model)   | Rarely (soldered)        | RAM slot config, BIOS, check HP support              |
| Spectre    | Win 10/11, Chrome OS | Not upgradable (soldered)         | Not supported            | All RAM/CPU typically soldered, BIOS                 |
| Omen       | Win 10/11, Chrome OS | Up to 32GB (2 slots typical)      | Possible (some models)   | BIOS version, chipset, thermal design, RAM slots     |
| EliteBook  | Win 10/11, Chrome OS | Up to 32GB (most models)          | Rarely (soldered)        | BIOS, RAM slot config, model-specific documentation  |

**Note:** Always check the service manual and HP support documentation for your exact model before attempting hardware upgrades. Many HP laptop CPUs and RAM are soldered and not upgradable, especially in thin-and-light models (Spectre, some Envy). BIOS version and chipset support are critical for CPU upgrades. RAM upgrades are limited by slot count and maximum supported by the motherboard.
