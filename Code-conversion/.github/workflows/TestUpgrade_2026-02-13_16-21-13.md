# Upgrade Scripts & Testing Details

## HP Pavilion Upgrade Script
```python
import subprocess

def upgrade_pavilion():
    # Pre-upgrade checks
    print("Checking BIOS version...")
    subprocess.run(["wmic", "bios", "get", "version"])
    print("Enable TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot for Windows 11...")
    subprocess.run(["powershell", "-Command", "Set-TPMEnabled -Enabled $true"])
    subprocess.run(["powershell", "-Command", "Set-SecureBootUEFI -Enable $true"])
    # RAM upgrade (if not soldered)
    print("Upgrade RAM: Install up to 32GB DDR4-3200MHz (check slots, hybrid configs)")
    # Instructions: Shut down, remove back cover, insert compatible SODIMM modules
    # OS upgrade
    print("Upgrading OS to Windows 11...")
    subprocess.run(["powershell", "-Command", "Start-Process 'setup.exe' -ArgumentList '/auto upgrade' -Wait"])
    # Storage upgrade
    print("Upgrading storage to NVMe SSD...")
    # Instructions: Shut down, remove back cover, replace/install NVMe SSD
    print("Install latest Intel/AMD chipset drivers.")
    subprocess.run(["powershell", "-Command", "Install-HPDriverPack -Model Pavilion"])
    print("Upgrade complete. Please restart and validate system stability.")

upgrade_pavilion()
```

### Testing Details
- **Test Codes**: BIOS check, TPM/Secure Boot enable, RAM/SSD installation, OS upgrade, driver installation.
- **Pass/Rate**: All steps must return success (no error codes).
- **Recommendations**: Backup data before upgrade, validate warranty, check RAM slots.
- **Troubleshooting**: If BIOS/TPM fails, update firmware; if RAM not detected, reseat modules; if OS fails, check installation media.

**Note:** All scripts assume proper hardware is available and compatible, BIOS is updated, and Windows installation media is accessible. Processor upgrades are not possible due to soldered CPUs; RAM upgrades depend on model configuration. Always back up data and verify warranty status before upgrading.
