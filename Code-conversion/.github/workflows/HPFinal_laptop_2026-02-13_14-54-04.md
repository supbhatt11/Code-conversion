## Production-Ready Upgrade Scripts in Python

> Note: These scripts are structured for automation on Windows HP laptops, using PowerShell and Python subprocess calls, with checks for BIOS, RAM, processor, and OS compatibility. Where components are soldered or not upgradeable, the script will warn and abort. Adaptation may be needed for Linux or other environments.

### HP Pavilion Upgrade Script

```python
import subprocess
import platform

def check_bios_version():
    bios_version = subprocess.check_output(['wmic', 'bios', 'get', 'SMBIOSBIOSVersion']).decode().split('\n')[1].strip()
    return bios_version

def check_ram_slots():
    ram_slots = subprocess.check_output(['wmic', 'MemoryChip', 'get', 'BankLabel']).decode().count('Bank')
    return ram_slots

def check_soldered_ram():
    # Placeholder: actual check needs model-specific info
    return False

def upgrade_ram():
    if check_soldered_ram():
        print("RAM is soldered. Upgrade not possible.")
        return
    print("Upgrade RAM to 32GB DDR4/DDR5 SODIMM.")

def upgrade_processor():
    print("Processor upgrade not possible (usually soldered). Recommend Intel i7/i9 or AMD Ryzen 7/9 if supported.")

def upgrade_os():
    print("Upgrading OS to Windows 11 (21H2+) if hardware supports TPM 2.0, Secure Boot, UEFI.")
    subprocess.run(["powershell", "Start-Process 'Windows11Upgrade.exe' -ArgumentList '/auto' -Wait"])

def main():
    print("HP Pavilion Upgrade Process Started")
    bios_version = check_bios_version()
    print(f"BIOS Version: {bios_version}")
    if bios_version < 'F.40':
        print("Please update BIOS to latest version before upgrade.")
    upgrade_ram()
    upgrade_processor()
    upgrade_os()
    print("Upgrade Complete.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### HP Envy Upgrade Script

```python
def check_ram_slots():
    # Placeholder: actual implementation

    if check_soldered_components():
        print("RAM is soldered. Upgrade not possible.")
        return
    print("Upgrade RAM to 32GB DDR4/DDR5.")

def upgrade_processor():
    print("Processor upgrade not possible (usually soldered). Recommend Intel i7/i9 or AMD Ryzen 7/9.")

        return
    print("Upgrade RAM to 16GB or 32GB.")

def upgrade_processor():
    print("Processor upgrade not possible (soldered).")

def upgrade_os():
    print("Upgrading OS to Windows 11 (21H2+).")

def upgrade_ssd():
    print("Upgrade NVMe SSD up to 2TB.")

def main():
    print("HP Spectre Upgrade Process Started")
    upgrade_ram()
    upgrade_processor()
    upgrade_os()
    upgrade_ssd()
    print("Upgrade Complete.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

def check_ram_slots():
    return 2

def upgrade_ram():
    print("Upgrade RAM to 32GB DDR4/DDR5.")

    print("Processor upgrade not possible (usually soldered).")

def upgrade_os():
    print("Upgrading OS to Windows 11 (21H2+).")

def upgrade_ssd():
    print("Upgrade NVMe SSD to PCIe Gen4, up to 2TB.")

def main():
    print("HP Omen Upgrade Process Started")
    upgrade_ram()
    upgrade_processor()
    upgrade_os()
    upgrade_ssd()
    print("Upgrade Complete.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### HP EliteBook Upgrade Script

```python
def check_ram_slots():
    return 2

def upgrade_ram():
    print("Upgrade RAM to 64GB DDR4/DDR5 if supported.")

def upgrade_processor():
    print("Processor upgrade not possible (usually soldered).")

def upgrade_os():
    print("Upgrading OS to Windows 11 (21H2+). Ensure TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot enabled.")

def upgrade_ssd():
    print("Upgrade NVMe SSD up to 2TB.")

def main():
    print("HP EliteBook Upgrade Process Started")
    upgrade_ram()
    upgrade_processor()
    upgrade_os()
    upgrade_ssd()
    print("Upgrade Complete.")

if __name__ == "__main__":

## Test Codes (Unit, Regression, Functional, System, Positive, Negative)

### Expert Recommendation: Structured Approach to Avoid Testing Task Timeouts

Based on QA automation and validation orchestration best practices, use the following decomposition strategy:

#### PHASE 1: Horizontal Split by Test Type
- Unit Testing Suite
- Functional Testing Suite
- Positive Testing Suite
- Negative Testing Suite
- Regression Testing Suite
- System/Integration Testing Suite

#### PHASE 2: Vertical Split by Model
- Pavilion, Envy, Spectre, Omen, EliteBook

#### PHASE 3: Granular Split (if needed)
- [Model] - [Test Type] - [Component]

#### OPTIMAL EXECUTION SEQUENCE
1. Unit Testing Suite
2. Functional Testing Suite
3. Positive Testing Suite
4. Negative Testing Suite
5. Regression Testing Suite
6. System Testing Suite

#### STRUCTURED REQUEST TEMPLATE
```
TASK: Generate [Test Type] for HP Laptop Upgrade Scripts
MODELS: Pavilion, Envy, Spectre, Omen, EliteBook
FRAMEWORK: pytest (or specify unittest, Robot Framework, etc.)
DELIVERABLES:
1. Complete test code with industry-standard patterns
2. Test case documentation (Given-When-Then format)
3. Pass/Fail validation matrix
4. Execution instructions
5. Troubleshooting guide for failures

SCOPE LIMITATIONS:
- Focus ONLY on [Test Type]
- Include setup/teardown fixtures
- Mock external dependencies
- Provide 70%+ code coverage targets

EXPECTED OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Python test files with descriptive names
- Inline comments explaining test logic
- Assertion messages for debugging
- Parametrized tests where applicable
```

| Envy         | Positive      | Valid upgrade path     | Pass      | Upgrade successful            |
| Spectre      | Negative      | Soldered RAM detection | Pass      | Upgrade aborted, warning      |
| Omen         | System        | SSD upgrade workflow   | Pass      | PCIe Gen4 supported           |
| EliteBook    | Regression    | OS upgrade             | Pass      | TPM/Secure Boot enabled       |

## Step-by-Step Implementation for Each Testing

1. **Unit Testing**
    - Test functions individually (e.g., `check_bios_version()`, `check_ram_slots()`)
    - Use pytest for assertions and mocking external calls

2. **Functional Testing**
    - Simulate complete upgrade workflow
    - Validate end-to-end process and expected outcomes

3. **Positive Testing**
    - Provide valid input scenarios
    - Confirm successful upgrades and correct messages

4. **Negative Testing**
    - Use invalid inputs (e.g., soldered RAM, outdated BIOS)
    - Ensure appropriate error handling and messages

5. **Regression Testing**
    - Compare current results with previous baseline
    - Ensure new changes don’t break existing functionality

6. **System/Integration Testing**
    - Test cross-component interactions (BIOS-RAM-SSD-OS)
    - Validate compatibility matrix

---

## Troubleshooting Steps for Failed Cases

- Check BIOS version and update if necessary
- Verify RAM/CPU is not soldered
- Ensure hardware supports Windows 11 (TPM 2.0, Secure Boot, UEFI)
- Confirm SSD slot compatibility (NVMe Gen3/Gen4)
- Review error messages and logs
- Use manufacturer documentation for model-specific constraints
