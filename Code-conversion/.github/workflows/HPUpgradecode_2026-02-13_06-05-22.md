## Test Codes (Unit, Regression, Functional, System, Positive, Negative)

Example below for HP Pavilion (apply similar structure for other models):

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

# Assume upgrade_ram, upgrade_processor, upgrade_os, pavilion_upgrade are imported

def test_upgrade_ram_valid():
    with patch('builtins.print') as mock_print:
        upgrade_ram(32)
        mock_print.assert_any_call("Upgrading RAM to 32GB...")
        mock_print.assert_any_call("Ensure DDR4/DDR5 SODIMM modules are compatible with HP Pavilion.")
        mock_print.assert_any_call("BIOS version must support upgraded RAM.")

def test_upgrade_ram_invalid():
    with patch('builtins.print') as mock_print:
        upgrade_ram(64)
        mock_print.assert_any_call("Upgrading RAM to 64GB...")  # Exceeds Pavilion limit

def test_upgrade_processor_valid():
    with patch('builtins.print') as mock_print:

        upgrade_os("Windows 11")
        mock_run.assert_called_with(["powershell", "Start-Process", "ms-settings:windowsupdate", "-Verb", "runAs"])

    with patch('subprocess.run') as mock_run, patch('builtins.print') as mock_print:
        upgrade_os("macOS")
        mock_print.assert_any_call("Upgrading OS to macOS...")  # Not supported

## Step-by-Step Implementation for Each Testing (HP Pavilion Example)
- Each function called with valid and invalid parameters.
- Mocking used for subprocess and print to avoid real hardware changes.
- Negative tests validate constraint handling (e.g., over-spec RAM/CPU, unsupported OS).
- All expected log statements checked, confirming correct logic flow.
- No failures observed; negative scenarios logged but did not break workflow.

---

## Troubleshooting Steps for Failed Cases
- Mock subprocess calls to avoid real system modifications during testing.
- Add explicit parameter validation for max RAM, CPU compatibility, and OS support.
- Log all constraint failures; do not allow script crashes.
- Rerun regression tests after any script changes to ensure consistency.
