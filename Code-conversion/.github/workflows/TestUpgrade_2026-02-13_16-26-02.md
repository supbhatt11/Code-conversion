## Summary Table of Logs (Dependencies and Constraints)

| Model     | Max RAM | CPU Upgradeable | Min BIOS | TPM | Secure Boot | Constraints                        |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|----------|-----|------------|------------------------------------|
| Pavilion  | 32GB    | No              | F.20     | Yes | Yes        | BIOS version, TPM, Secure Boot     |
| Envy      | 32GB    | No              | F.25     | Yes | Yes        | BIOS version, TPM, Secure Boot     |
| Spectre   | 32GB    | No              | F.30     | Yes | Yes        | BIOS version, TPM, Secure Boot     |
| Omen      | 64GB    | Yes             | F.15     | Yes | Yes        | BIOS version, TPM, Secure Boot     |
| EliteBook | 64GB    | No              | F.40     | Yes | Yes        | BIOS version, TPM, Secure Boot     |

**Notes:**
- CPU upgrade is only possible for Omen (some models, MXM socket), not for others (soldered).
- RAM upgrade is possible for all except Spectre (soldered).
- OS upgrade is possible for all models.
- BIOS, TPM, and Secure Boot are mandatory dependencies for Windows 11 upgrades.

## Troubleshooting & Recommendations

- Ensure BIOS is updated to the minimum required version before upgrades.
- TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot must be enabled for Windows 11 installation.
- For Omen models, verify CPU socket type before attempting processor upgrade.
- For Spectre, RAM is soldered and cannot be upgraded.
- Always backup data before performing upgrades.
