# 7. Step-by-Step Implementation for Each Testing

## Example: Pavilion

1. **Unit Test:** Run Python unit tests for BIOS and driver installation.
2. **Regression Test:** Execute PowerShell to fetch Windows Update logs.
3. **Functional Test:** Use PowerShell to verify secure channel.
4. **System Test:** Check OS version via systeminfo.
5. **Positive Test:** Confirm BIOS updater presence.
6. **Negative Test:** Simulate missing driver and check error handling.

Repeat the above steps for Envy, Spectre, Omen, and EliteBook, adjusting the driver type as per the model.

---

# 8. Troubleshooting Steps for Failed Cases

- **BIOS Update Fails:** Ensure the BIOS updater path is correct and run as administrator.
- **Driver Installation Fails:** Check driver package integrity and compatibility.
- **Regression Test Fails:** Review Windows Update logs for errors.
- **Functional Test Fails:** Rejoin the computer to the domain or reset secure channel.
- **System Test Fails:** Verify OS installation and update status.
- **Positive Test Fails:** Confirm the presence of required files.
- **Negative Test Fails:** Ensure error handling logic is implemented.

---

# 9. Recommendations

- Always backup data before running upgrade scripts.
- Run scripts with administrative privileges.
- Test on a non-production device before mass deployment.
- Keep drivers and BIOS up to date from HP official sources.
- Document all changes and test results for audit purposes.
