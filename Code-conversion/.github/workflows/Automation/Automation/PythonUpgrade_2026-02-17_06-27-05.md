# Detailed Pass/Fail Analysis

- Failures occur only when hardware is physically non-upgradeable (e.g., soldered RAM/CPU).
- All positive and functional tests pass when dependencies are met (TPM, BIOS, UEFI, RAM type, etc.).
- Negative tests correctly block upgrades if requirements (e.g., TPM) are not present.
- Regression/system tests confirm compatibility between BIOS version and new hardware.
- No test failures are due to script errors; all failures are due to hardware constraints.

---

# Recommendations & Troubleshooting Steps

- **BIOS Upgrade Fails**: Ensure correct BIOS version is downloaded from HP’s official support website. Use HP BIOS Update utility.
- **RAM Not Detected**: Power cycle the laptop, reseat modules, and ensure correct RAM type (see manual).
- **OS Upgrade Blocked**: Check TPM status in BIOS, enable Secure Boot/UEFI, and verify CPU generation.
- **Performance Issues After Upgrade**: Update all drivers using HP Support Assistant, check for BIOS/firmware updates, and ensure RAM modules are matched for dual-channel operation.
- **Upgrade Not Supported**: If CPU/RAM is soldered, hardware upgrade is not possible. Consider external upgrade options (e.g., USB storage) or replacement models.
