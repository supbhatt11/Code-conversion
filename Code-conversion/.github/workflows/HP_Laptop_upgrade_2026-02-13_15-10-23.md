## 4. Missing Upgrade Scripts and Recommendations

**Current Status:**
- The required production-ready Python upgrade scripts for OS, processor, and RAM upgrades for each model are NOT available in the directory.
- No installation logs, execution logs, error logs, or validation outputs are present.
- No model-specific configuration files or dependency management files found.

**Impact on Testing:**
- Cannot proceed with unit, regression, system, functional, positive, or negative testing.
- Cannot generate test code, pass/fail matrix, validation reports, or troubleshooting recommendations.

**Recommendations:**
- Request Agent 1 to provide:
  - Complete Python upgrade scripts for all 5 HP laptop models
  - Execution logs from initial script runs
  - Configuration files and dependencies list
  - Supporting modules or utility scripts
  - Documentation on script parameters and usage

**Conclusion:**
- Only a specifications document exists.
- Additional files containing the actual executable Python upgrade scripts must be provided before comprehensive QA automation and validation testing can begin.
