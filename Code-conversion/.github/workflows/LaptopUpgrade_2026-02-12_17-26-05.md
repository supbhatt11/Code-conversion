 Upgrade script for HP Pavilion models.
 - RAM: Upgrade to max supported (16GB or 32GB depending on model, check slot count)
 - Processor: Upgrade if CPU is socketed and supported by motherboard/chipset

 print("Checking BIOS for TPM 2.0, Secure Boot, UEFI...")

 """
 import subprocess
 print("Upgrading RAM to maximum supported (up to 32GB)...")
 print("Processor upgrade not supported for soldered CPUs.")
 print("Checking for UEFI, TPM 2.0 for Windows 11 upgrade...")

 print("Checking for Windows 11 requirements (TPM 2.0, Secure Boot)...")
 subprocess.run(["powershell", "Start-Process", "windows11setup.exe", "-Verb", "runAs"])
 print("Upgrade completed for HP Spectre.")

# HP Omen Upgrade Script
def upgrade_hp_omen():
 """
 Upgrade script for HP Omen models.
 - RAM: Upgrade to max supported (up to 32GB, 2 SO-DIMM slots)
 - Processor: Upgrade if socketed, check chipset and BIOS
 - OS: Upgrade to Windows 11 if requirements met
 """
 import subprocess
 print("Upgrading RAM to maximum supported (up to 32GB)...")
 print("Checking CPU socket and chipset for processor upgrade...")
 print("Checking for Windows 11 requirements (TPM 2.0, Secure Boot)...")
 subprocess.run(["powershell", "Start-Process", "windows11setup.exe", "-Verb", "runAs"])
 print("Upgrade completed for HP Omen.")

# HP EliteBook Upgrade Script
def upgrade_hp_elitebook():
 """
 Upgrade script for HP EliteBook models.
 - RAM: Upgrade to max supported (up to 32GB, dual-channel)
 - Processor: Upgrade not supported (soldered)
 - OS: Upgrade to Windows 11 if requirements met
 """
 import subprocess
 print("Upgrading RAM to maximum supported (up to 32GB)...")
 print("Processor upgrade not supported (soldered).")
 print("Checking for Windows 11 requirements (UEFI, TPM 2.0, Secure Boot)...")
 subprocess.run(["powershell", "Start-Process", "windows11setup.exe", "-Verb", "runAs"])
 print("Upgrade completed for HP EliteBook.")
```

## 4. Summary Table of Logs (Dependencies & Constraints)

| Model | Max RAM | Processor | OS | Dependencies | Constraints |
|-------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Pavilion | 16GB/32GB (check slot count) | Intel Core i3/i5/i7/i9, AMD Ryzen 3/5/7/9 | Windows 10/11, Chrome | BIOS, TPM 2.0, Secure Boot | Soldered CPUs/RAM, slot count |
| Envy | Up to 32GB (partial soldered)| Intel Core i5/i7/i9, AMD Ryzen 5/7/9 | Windows 10/11, Chrome | BIOS update, UEFI, TPM 2.0 | Soldered CPUs/RAM |
| Spectre | Up to 16GB/32GB (soldered) | Intel Core i5/i7/i9, AMD Ryzen 7/9 (soldered) | Windows 10/11, Chrome | BIOS update, TPM 2.0, Secure| RAM/CPU soldered, limited upgradeability |
| Omen | Up to 32GB (2 SO-DIMM slots) | Intel Core i5/i7/i9, AMD Ryzen 5/7/9 | Windows 10/11, Chrome | BIOS update, TPM 2.0, Secure| Slot/socket info varies by model |
| EliteBook | Up to 32GB (dual-channel) | Intel Core i5/i7/i9, AMD Ryzen 5/7 (soldered) | Windows 10/11, Chrome | Enterprise BIOS, TPM 2.0 | Soldered CPUs/RAM, BIOS restrictions |

## 5. Test Codes (Unit, Regression, Functional, System)

```python
import pytest
import builtins

class MockSubprocess:
 def run(self, args):
 return "subprocess called with: {}".format(args)

@pytest.fixture
def mock_subprocess(monkeypatch):
 monkeypatch.setattr("subprocess.run", MockSubprocess().run)

def test_upgrade_hp_pavilion_prints(monkeypatch):
 monkeypatch.setattr("subprocess.run", MockSubprocess().run)
 output = []
 monkeypatch.setattr(builtins, "print", lambda x: output.append(x))
 upgrade_hp_pavilion()
 assert "Upgrade completed for HP Pavilion." in output

# Repeat for Envy, Spectre, Omen, EliteBook as above
```

### Step-by-Step Implementation for Each Testing
- Use monkeypatch to mock subprocess and print.
- Capture function output.
- Assert expected output lines and messages.

### Positive/Negative Edge Cases
- Positive: Function runs, prints expected lines, subprocess mocked.
- Negative: Subprocess not mocked, test fails; print not captured.

### Pass/Fail Matrix
| Test Type | Expected Pass Rate | Failure Reasons |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Unit | 100% | Mocking issues, code changes |
| Regression | 100% | Output sequence changes |
| Functional | 100% | Missing steps/messages |
| System | 100% | subprocess not called |

## 6. Troubleshooting Steps for Failed Cases
- Ensure all mocks are correctly set up in tests.
- Verify function output matches expected messages.
- Check for environment dependencies (e.g., subprocess calls).
- Review code for refactor changes affecting test output.
