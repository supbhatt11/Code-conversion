## Missing Upgrade Scripts and Detailed Outputs

**Notice:**
- The directory does NOT contain the actual upgrade scripts, test codes, troubleshooting steps, or recommendations generated by Agent 1 and Agent 2.
- Only "HP Laptop Models.txt" is accessible, which provides a high-level overview but not the required technical detail.

### Recommendation
- Verify that Agent 1 completed their task and generated the upgrade scripts.
- Ensure that the detailed output file (such as HP_Laptop_Upgrade_Scripts_and_Analysis.txt) exists and is accessible.
- Check file permissions or path configurations that might be preventing access.
- Contact Agent 1 or the system administrator to confirm the location and accessibility of the upgrade scripts.
